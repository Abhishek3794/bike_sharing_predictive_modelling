## General Information
- A ***bike-sharing*** system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free.

- Many bike share systems allow people to borrow a bike from a "dock" which is usually computer-controlled wherein the user enters the payment information, and the system unlocks it. This bike can then be returned to another dock belonging to the same system.

- The data used for this predictive modelling assignment contains the bike rental data of BoomBikes from 2018 to 2019.



## Problem Statement
- ***BoomBikes***, a US bike rental service provider has suffered losses in their revenues due to the pandemic and as a result, is finding it difficult to sustain their business.For this, BoomBikes wants to understand the different factors which affect the demand for the shared bikes.



## Technologies Used
- ***Python*** - version ***3.x***
- ***pandas*** - version ***1.4.2***
- ***numpy*** - version ***1.21.5***
- ***matplotlib*** - version ***3.5.1***
- ***seaborn*** - version ***0.11.2***
- ***sklearn*** - version ***1.0.2***
- ***statsmodels*** - version ***0.13.2***



## Conclusions
- ***Most significant features*** - The ___atemp__, ___weathersit_Light_Rain_Snow___ and ___yr___ are the most significant features in explaining the changes in the demand for the shared bike service.

- ***Year*** - The total bikes rented increased as we went from 2018 to 2019. This could be because of more advertisement, more popularity about the service and, the service being accessible in a greater number of areas and, an increase in the inventory.

- ***Weather*** - The demand of the bike rental was way more on a clear or a partly cloudy day than a rainy day.

- ***Temperature*** - The demand for the shared bikes has a positive correlation with the feature atemp i.e., the "feeling" temperature.

- ***Holiday*** - The median of the demand for rental bikes was lower on holidays than other days.

- ***Season*** - The demand was the highest during the summer and the fall seasons and the lowest during spring.

- ***Months*** - The demand was much higher during the summer and fall months (April-Oct) than the other months i.e., during the summer and fall seasons as observed earlier.
